# Flutter To-Do App

This is a Flutter to-do app designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app leverages several powerful packages to provide a robust and responsive experience, including _`flutter_slidable`_ for interactive list items, _`hydrated_bloc`_ and _`flutter_bloc`_ for state management, and _`path_provider`_ for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, delete and mark as complete tasks easily.
- **Interactive Task List**: Integrates _`flutter_slidable`_ for swipe actions on list items.
- **Persistent State**: Uses _`hydrated_bloc`_ to persist state changes locally.
- **State Management**: Utilizes _`flutter_bloc`_ and _`bloc`_ for managing application state in a scalable way.
- **Equality Comparisons**: Implements _`equatable`_ for value comparison in state management.
- **Path Provider**: Uses _`path_provider`_ for locating the file system paths to store data persistently.
